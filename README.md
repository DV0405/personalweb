# PersonalWeb

Log: Aug. 3rd, 2021
    I am creating a portfolio website to store a lot of what I do and what kinds of things I am interested in. I have very minimal experience working with web design but I think       it's a great place to learn. Not using any API's, just plain old HTML, CSS, and JS. At the moment, there is no domain attatched to this website, as I am hosting it locally on     my machine. However, once developed for the most part, having minimal bugs and the majority of the information, I will release it.
